        <h2>by Anel Reinoso 7th period</h2>
        <p> <strong>/ᐠ｡ꞈ｡ᐟ\</strong> </p>
        <p> His fur is as white as snow, </p>
        <p> It's almost as pretty as his bow, <p>
        <p> He is always so playful, <p>
        <p> Because he's always joyful, <p>
        <p> He loves the outdoors, <p>
        <p> But he prefers to be indoors, <p>
        <p> He loves getting treats, <p>
        <p> Almost as much as he loves to lay on my sheets, <p>
        <p> He has a problem with biting, <p>
        <p> But he still have to treat him like a king, <p>
        <p> He loves chin scratches, <p>
        <p> And gives all us headaches, <p>
        <p> My love for him is so great, <p>
        <p> No one could ever replace. <p>
